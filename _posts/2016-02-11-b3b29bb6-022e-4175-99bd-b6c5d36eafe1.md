Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Oh, oh Marty, here's you keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Stop it. What?

What the hell is a gigawatt? It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Ahh. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her-

No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Will you take care of that?
